        descr: 'In 2016 we decided to participate in an international exhibition in Dubai. Strange decisions are not part of ETG’s values, so in order to take part in an exhibition we urgently needed to come up with <b>a new brand name</b>.<br /><br /> To brainstorm, the executive team together with Felix locked themselves up in a meeting room and agreed not to leave it until they came up with a catchy name. Fortunately, the deadline was looming, so this agreement posed no threat.<br /><br /> From the beginning, we wanted to reflect in the name that the platform has the most <b>favorable rates</b>, and then someone came up with the idea of a hawk looking for its prey, like us for favorable rates. That’s how the name RateHawk came about.',

        descr: 'Chocolate salami is a dessert made of dark chocolate, cookies, egg, butter and port wine or rum. It is especially popular in Italy, Portugal, Russia and ETG. It dates back to the days when remote working had not yet been invented and the team <b>celebrated records and achievements</b> together. Or rather used them as an excuse to eat chocolate salami and drink chocolate milk.<br /><br /> Either way, the tradition has survived to this day, so the occasional Slack question &quot;Will there be chocolate milk?&quot; can be answered with confidence that ETG will continue to order chocolate milk to offices on important occasions and write a big check to chocolate salami vendors.',

        descr: '<b>Customized Profile</b>:<br /><br /> One of ETG’s values is freedom, such as the freedom to specify just about anything you want in your Intranet profile, such as providing your car’s license plate number for parking or add your custom position in the company (Lord of the Frontend will confirm it really is possible).<br /><br /><b>Office Climate Control</b>:<br /><br /> ETG employees were once unhappy with the air quality in the office, and that’s when the Intranet became the place to see the temperature, humidity, and CO2 status of the office. Thus, even the decision of &quot;when to ventilate&quot; became analytics-driven.<br /><br /><b>Online store</b>:<br /><br /> During one of the winters, Evgeny Khitrik found a reliable supplier of high-quality winter windshield washer at an affordable price, after which each employee could go to a special page on the Intranet and order this cleaning liquid directly to the workplace. Later the assortment and delivery area expanded: you could even get a roll of toilet paper directly to the toilet cubicle.<br /><br /><b>Valentine’s Day Hearts</b>:<br /><br /> One day, art director Niaz came up with the idea of a game for Valentine’s Day. There was little time to prepare, the idea seemed naive, but all these excuses didn’t work because the layouts were too good. The entire functionality was created in one night. The next day the work in the office came to a standstill as everyone tried to figure out who was sending a heart to whom, and so a tradition was born.',
